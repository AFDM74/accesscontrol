**Installation Instructions:

Currently there is no installation script, so you will have to:

1) Copy the scripts/init.d/accesscontrol file to your /etc/init.d/ directory.

2) Copy the rpi/access.py file to the usr/bin/ directory and rename it to accesscontrol.

3) Copy the conf/ folder contents to /etc/accesscontrol/

After that you will need to configure the software. To do this follow rmiller's install instructions inside the rpi/ directory.
