accesscontrol
=============

Access Control System Software

This is the software for the access control system created for ctrl-h,
a hackerspace in Portland, OR.

Schematics will be available at some point.  Currently only the code
is available.

Uses the wiegand library from https://github.com/monkeyboard/Wiegand-Protocol-Library-for-Arduino.

The contents of the linino directory go into the Yun - preferably on an SD
card.  Sample JSON config files are provided.

The contents of the arduino directory go to the atmel chip through the arduino
IDE.
